Projects for Foundations of Bioinformatics course at Vanderbilt University in Fall 2021.

Project 1 has been uploaded with a Python notebook and an R markdown notebook.The raw single cell RNA-seq data was too large (>100 MB) to be pushed to GitHub, but is avialable upon request and can also be downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138474.
